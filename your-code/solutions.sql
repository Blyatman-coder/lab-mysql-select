Challenge 1 - Who Have Published What At Where?

In this challenge you will write a MySQL `SELECT` query that joins
various tables to figure out what titles each author has published at which publishers.
Your output should have at least the following columns:

* `AUTHOR ID` - the ID of the author
* `LAST NAME` - author last name
* `FIRST NAME` - author first name
* `TITLE` - name of the published title
* `PUBLISHER` - name of the publisher where the title was published

If your query is correct, the total rows in your output should be the same
as the total number of records in Table `titleauthor`.

Challenge 2 - Who Have Published How Many At Where?

Elevating from your solution in Challenge 1, query how many titles each author has published at each publisher.
To check if your output is correct, sum up the `TITLE COUNT` column.
The sum number should be the same as the total number of records in Table `titleauthor`.

Challenge 3 - Best Selling Authors

Who are the top 3 authors who have sold the highest number of titles? Write a query to find out.
Requirements:
* Your output should have the following columns:
	* `AUTHOR ID` - the ID of the author
	* `LAST NAME` - author last name
	* `FIRST NAME` - author first name
	* `TOTAL` - total number of titles sold from this author
* Your output should be ordered based on `TOTAL` from high to low.
* Only output the top 3 best selling authors.

Challenge 4 - Best Selling Authors Ranking

Now modify your solution in Challenge 3 so that the output will
display all 23 authors instead of the top 3.
Note that the authors who have sold 0 titles should also appear in your output
(ideally display `0` instead of `NULL` as the `TOTAL`).
Also order your results based on `TOTAL` from high to low.
